    Hello! I'm @sodabottlebaby, a novice in Software Engineering. ðŸª¼ Iâ€™m interested in learning Full Stack Development, DevOps and Cloud Computing. I also write non-tech related blogs, poetry and prose on <a href="https://www.minervamemoirs.com/">my blog</a>. Hoping to improve my skills tremendously this year!
